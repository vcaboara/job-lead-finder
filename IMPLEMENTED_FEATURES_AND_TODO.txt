Job Lead Finder: Implemented Features & TODOs

Implemented Features

Core Functionality
- FastAPI UI server with REST endpoints for search, config, resume upload, block list, and health check
- Single-page web UI (HTML/JS) for job search, resume upload, config management, and results display
- Gemini AI integration (google-generativeai or legacy google.genai) for real job search and evaluation
- Fallback local search when no Gemini API key or provider unavailable
- Resume upload: .txt and .md files, with size/type/UTF-8 validation and injection scanning
- Resume paste: textarea allows manual paste/edit
- Block list management: add/remove blocked sites and employers via UI and API
- Link validation: checks job links, annotates with status/warning/error
- Filtering: excludes jobs with blocked sites/employers, 403/404 links, localhost, and search-result URLs
- Auto-evaluate: if resume is present, jobs are scored automatically
- Config persistence: config.json, resume.txt, and uploads/ are gitignored
- Multi-stage Dockerfile: builder installs all deps; runtime is slim with only venv and app
- Comprehensive tests: 113 passing tests for endpoints, config, search, upload, and validation
- Logs: Gemini response logs and diagnostics written to logs/ folder

UI Features
- Search form: query, resume upload/paste, result count
- Results panel: job cards with title, company, location, summary, score, reasoning, and link
- Progress/status indicator: shows search status and errors
- Config panel: block list management, link validator
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

Security & Validation
- Injection scanning: system instructions, resume, and block list entries scanned for injection-like patterns
- File validation: resume uploads limited to 1MB, .txt/.md, UTF-8 only
- Link validation: checks for valid URLs and annotates with status/warning/error

DevOps & Packaging
- Multi-stage Dockerfile: builder + runtime for smaller images
- docker-compose.yml: separate app and ui services, environment variable support
- .env support: for API keys
- .gitignore: excludes config.json, resume.txt, uploads/

Known Issues / Limitations
- Job count may be less than requested due to filtering invalid/blocked/bad links
- List may disappear if all jobs are filtered out (no valid results)
- Gemini provider may return jobs with bad links; filtering is post-processing
- No PDF/DOCX resume support yet (only .txt/.md)
- No image upload/preview yet
- No advanced search options (location, salary, etc.)

TODOs
- Add PDF/DOCX resume support using pdfplumber and python-docx; update Dockerfile and tests
- Plan smaller images feature: image uploads with size/type limits and preview
- Improve Gemini prompt to prioritize real postings with direct links
- Handle empty results gracefully with a clear message
- Advanced filtering to block more link patterns (e.g., search-result URLs)
- User feedback for excluded jobs (warnings or reasons)
- Optional: add OCR for image resumes
- Optional: add advanced search filters (location, salary, etc.)
