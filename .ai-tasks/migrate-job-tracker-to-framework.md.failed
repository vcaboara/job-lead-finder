# Task: Migrate job_tracker to Framework

## Objective
Migrate job_tracker functionality to the framework structure by moving job_tracker_new.py to framework/tracker/ and updating all references.

## Steps

1. **Move File**
   - Move `job_tracker_new.py` to `framework/tracker/job_tracker.py`
   - Ensure framework/tracker/ directory exists

2. **Update Imports**
   - Find all files importing from job_tracker or job_tracker_new
   - Update imports to use `framework.tracker.job_tracker`
   - Key files to check:
     - app/*.py files
     - tests/test_*.py files
     - Any other modules using job tracker

3. **Remove Old File**
   - Delete old `job_tracker.py` if it exists
   - Verify no remaining references to old file

4. **Update Tests**
   - Update test imports to use new location
   - Run tests to ensure all pass: `pytest tests/test_job_tracker.py -v`
   - Fix any import or path issues

## Success Criteria
- [ ] job_tracker_new.py moved to framework/tracker/job_tracker.py
- [ ] All imports updated to framework.tracker.job_tracker
- [ ] Old job_tracker.py removed
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No import errors in codebase

## Context
- Framework structure is in framework/ directory
- Tests are in tests/ directory
- Main app code is in app/ directory
- Use grep to find all references: `grep -r "job_tracker" --include="*.py"`

## Notes
- Preserve all functionality during migration
- Ensure backward compatibility if needed
- Update any documentation referencing old paths
