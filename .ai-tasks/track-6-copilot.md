## Assigned Agent: COPILOT

## Objectives:
   1. Identify simple tasks suitable for small LMs (classification, extraction)
   2. Integrate efficient small models for:
   3. Job title classification
   4. Skills extraction from job descriptions
   5. Basic text summarization
   6. Duplicate detection
   7. Cost-performance optimization: use small LMs where possible

## Context:
- Project: Job Lead Finder (Python 3.12, FastAPI, Docker)
- Memory Bank: memory/ directory contains project documentation
- Code Style: Follow black, isort, flake8 standards
- Testing: Use pytest, aim for >80% coverage

## Workflow:
1. Read relevant Memory Bank files for context
2. Implement each objective sequentially
3. Write tests for new code
4. Run tests locally: pytest -m ""
5. Validate with pre-commit hooks
6. Create commits with clear messages

## Success Criteria:
- All objectives completed
- Tests passing
- Code passes linting (black, flake8)
- Documentation updated if needed

## Output:
When complete, create a PR with:
- Title: "Small Language Model Integration"
- Branch: auto/track-6-small-language-model-integrati
- Description: Checklist of completed objectives
