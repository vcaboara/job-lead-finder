# NOTE: If you have the official GitHub MCP running via Docker Desktop,
# you don't need to start it here. The application will connect to it
# using the MCP client or via HTTP if exposed.
#
# To use GitHub MCP from Docker Desktop:
# 1. Ensure GitHub MCP is enabled in Docker Desktop settings
# 2. Configure the app to search GitHub jobs via the MCP
# 3. The app will auto-detect and use it

  # GitHub MCP is typically run via Docker Desktop's built-in MCP support
  # The official GitHub MCP uses stdio protocol, not HTTP
  # To use it, we need to integrate with the MCP client SDK
