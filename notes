Please create a website with the functionality described. I'd prefer python and docker, however, if something else makes more sense, use it and explain it too me.
I would like increased configuration allowed via the web UI rather than having hardcoded strings in the code. Also allow for persistence of the various configurations, found jobs (tracking 403/404/etc. so as not to "find" them again).
I'll be using github for cicd and version control. Implement features in separate commits/branches/merges, with tests, coverage, healthchecks, frontend regression checks, etc.).
Additional human context:
I was trying to get work comp through my employer, which they denied and then terminated me. As such, we had to sell our home and move to a different county (said move broke our insurance), downsize our home, and in less than 2 weeks my son broke his arm (compound fracture requiring 2 surgeries to make sure it was "clean"). Wife thought she found a home we loved, until we moved in and now we see the things we dislike. I've been on state disability but that's 2/3s my regular salary which means not enough. I thought I'd be able to file a patent quickly enough to generate income but that hasn't been the case. As such I need to find a new job as insurance is also a massive concern. When I was laid off in 2023 it took me 4 months of constantly applying for jobs to find a new one. I can't do that now that my hands have been ruined by said job. I need AI to find jobs appropriate for me, help track their progress, weed out fake posts, etc.
It would be great to find a way to monetize this in a way that everyone can still use, not just people who already have money.

Gemini Suggestions
Implement advanced search filters for the Job Lead Finder application. Users should be able to input criteria such as desired location (city, state, country), salary range (min/max), experience level, and job type (full-time, part-time, contract). Update the UI to include these new filter options and modify the search endpoint to accept and process these parameters. Ensure that the Gemini AI integration and the local fallback search both utilize these new filters.

Add a user feedback mechanism to the Job Lead Finder. When a job is filtered out or appears irrelevant, provide a way for the user to flag it and optionally add a brief reason. Store this feedback and use it to refine the block list and filtering rules over time. The UI should include a way to view excluded jobs and their associated feedback. This could be a simple 'Provide Feedback' button on filtered-out job cards or a dedicated feedback section in the UI.
