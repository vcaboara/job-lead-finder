Strategic Initiatives & Impact Leadership
Arboreum Impact Foundation (AIF) | Strategic Technology Lead
Led the technological planning and initial R&D for the Arboreum Impact Foundation, demonstrating a rare synthesis of advanced engineering and humanitarian/environmental vision:
Climate & Sustainability R&D: Directed early-stage technological feasibility for developing sustainable bioplastic products (e.g., biodegradable paper airplanes) using agricultural waste feedstock, aligning infrastructure planning with environmental goals.
Systemic Reform Integration: Designed initial technical roadmaps to integrate support for AIF's key mandates (Native Americans, Immigrants, Veterans, and Orphans/Ages) into the foundation's operational and financial structures, leveraging technology to ensure ethical and targeted resource allocation.
Complex Problem Solving: Successfully navigated the technical evaluation phase following an 8-week prior art search (concluding late 2025) to confirm patent-worthy technological innovation, requiring deep collaboration with legal and scientific teams.
Professional Experience
Senior DevOps/Infrastructure Lead | [Previous Company Name]
Python Tooling Development: Engineered a Python-based CLI tool suite that standardized deployment workflows across 15+ microservices, reducing manual configuration errors by 40% and cutting deployment time by 50%.
CI/CD Optimization: Re-architected core CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins/GitLab) using Groovy and Python scripting, implementing dynamic environment provisioning and automated regression testing.
Infrastructure Automation (IaC): Utilized Terraform and Ansible to manage and provision 100% of cloud resources (AWS/Azure), achieving immutable infrastructure and enabling rapid environment scaling and replication.
Container Orchestration: Led the migration of legacy applications to Docker and Kubernetes, developing helm charts and YAML manifests to ensure self-healing and fault-tolerant service deployment.
